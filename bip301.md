BIP-301 Protocol Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

# Message headers
```
M7: [0xD1, 0x61, 0x73, 0x68]
M8: [0x00, 0xBF, 0x00]
```

# M7. BMM Accept
## Semantics

When an `M7` with sidechain block hash `H` is included in a mainchain block, it
means that the sidechain block with hash `H` is now blind merge mined.

So if it also passes the sidechain software validation rules, it can be
connected by the sidechain nodes.

## Encoding

An `M7` message MUST be encoded as a coinbase output.

A `scriptPubKey` encoding an `M7` BMM Accept message MUST have the following form:
```
OP_RETURN [0xD1, 0x61, 0x73, 0x68] <H>
```
where `H` is the block hash of the sidechain block to be blind merge mined.

The `nValue` of the coinbase output MUST be ignored.

# M8. BMM Request

## Semantics

An `M8` with sidechain block hash `H` is a an offer of a reward to the
mainchain miners for including an `M7` with a corresponding `H`.

A mainchain miner can only get the reward if it includes the corresponding `M7`.

The form the reward would take in the `M8` transaction is not specified here,
but most likely it would be a regular Bitcoin transaction output paying a sum
to an address controlled by the miner.

## Encoding

An `M8` BMM request message MUST be encoded as a regular Bitcoin transaction.

`M8`s are requests. When an `M8` request is pending, it exists in the Bitcoin
mempool as an unmined transaction.

When a miner fulfills an `M8` request, it MUST include it in a block along with
a corresponding `M7` coinbase output.

Output of `M8` at index 0 MUST have a `scriptPubKey` of the following form:
```
OP_RETURN [0x00, 0xBF, 0x00] <H> <S> <P>
```
where `H` is the sidechain block hash, `S` is the sidechain number, and `P` is
an array of the last four bytes of the previous main block hash.

The `nValue` of the output of `M8` at index 0 MUST be ignored.

The BIP301 enforcer software MUST not be concerned with any part of the `M8`
transaction other than the output at index 0 with the `OP_RETURN`.

# Validation Rules
If a block contains an `M8` transaction without the corresponding `M7` output,
then that block MUST be considered invalid.

Corresponding here means that the field `H` in `M8` is equal to the field `H`
in `M7`, meaning they both refer to the same sidechain block.

Note that a block MAY contain an `M7` coinbase output without a corresponding
`M8`, a miner MAY choose to blind merge mine a sidechain block without an
explicit `M8` request.
